## Key Features
* A username and password feature, with the added bonus of being able to randomly generate a password.
* A section explaining what the app is about.
* A legal terms and conditions section for a nice laugh ðŸ˜‚.
* 2 sections for testing Paper 1 content and Paper 2 content of A-level computer science. **NOTE:** Due to the limited time I had on this project, I could not do all topics of papers including the entirety of Paper 1.
* Within Paper 2, 4 difficulty modifiers with the added difficulty of hints and 'waffle' - waffle being funny sound effects that I personally either found online or _**made myself**_.
* Quizzes work as 'rounds', with rounds differing in number of questions and general difficulty of questions.
## Technologies used
* Python.
